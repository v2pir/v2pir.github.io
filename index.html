	      <h1>Codes For Us</h1>
	      <p> This website is the best place to be when you need help programming anything. I know I always referred to the internet for help. Best part? Its all free! No catch! No sign-up, no payment, its all out of the goodness of my heart :) I will post different codes maybe once a week, depending on how busy I am. This website is made using HTML so loading the page and seeing the updates will be very quick.</p>

	      <h3>About the creator</h3>
	      <p> Vansh Chhabra was always interested in making cool things. He would tinker around with small circuits and makes small fans and other things. He also loved reading comic books. Then he read a comic book about robots. That changed everything for him. He learned that everything does not rely on physics. He started to learn Python. He had originally started coding in 3rd grade, learning Scratch, but that was only because his school made him. He had learned python for 2 years until he started HTML. He was in 9th grade when he built this website.</p>

	      <h3>Why this website?</h3>
	      <p> When Vansh was learning Python, he came across many struggles. He would find bugs and they would give him a headache, just trying to find where the bug is. He would look online at already made codes and he would see how the programmer of those codes wrote those programs. Eventually, he started to learn how to identify a bug and where to look for it. He learned what the errors meant and how to fix them. This fascinated him. He decided to help other individuals learn code as well, hoping others would get as much out of it as he did.</p>

	      <h3>What you might find here</h3>
	      <p>I will try to post programs here once a month. I might not be able to some times because I might be busy with school. Here, you will find programs for simple games such as TicTacToe or Pong, or helpful tools such as calculators or many other things such as data organizer.</p>
